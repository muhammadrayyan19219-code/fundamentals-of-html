          <h2> Facts About Dogs </h2>
          <p> Dogs are domesticated mammals that humans have 
            been vibing with for thousands of years, originally
            trained for jobs like hunting, guarding, and 
            herding. They’ve got super sharp senses — especially
            smell — which is why they’re used in search-and-
            rescue, medical detection, and police work. 
            Different breeds have different traits, from tiny
            companion pups to massive working dogs, but all 
            dogs rely on humans for care, training, and social
            interaction. They communicate through body language,
            vocal sounds, and scent, and they build strong bonds 
            with the people who look after them. </p>

          <h2> Facts About Cats </h2>
          <p> Cats are domesticated felines known for their 
                agility, independence, and sharp hunting 
                instincts. Even though they look chill, their 
                senses are super tuned — especially their 
                hearing and night vision — which comes from 
                their wild ancestors who hunted at dusk and 
                dawn. Cats use body language, purring, and 
                different meows to communicate with humans and 
                other animals. While they can be low-maintenance 
                pets compared to dogs, they still need proper 
                nutrition, enrichment, and social interaction to 
                stay healthy. Despite their independent vibe,
                most cats form strong bonds with their owners and
                thrive in safe, comfortable environments. </p>

          <h2> Facts About Lions </h2>
          <p> Lions are large, powerful felines known as the only
              big cats that actually live in social groups called 
              prides. A pride usually has related females, their 
              cubs, and a small number of males who protect the 
              territory. Lions are apex predators, meaning they 
              sit at the top of the food chain, hunting animals 
              like zebras, buffalo, and antelope. Even though male 
              lions get all the spotlight with their iconic manes, 
              the females are the main hunters and teamwork pros. 
              Lions mostly live in African savannas, and their 
              populations are dropping because of habitat loss and 
              human conflict, making conservation super important. </p>
